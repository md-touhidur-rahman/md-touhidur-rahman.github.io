I am a Data Science M.Sc. student at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg with hands-on experience in business intelligence, data strategy, and workflow automation. My work focuses on turning raw data into transparent, actionable insights using Python, Power BI, and applied machine learning.

I enjoy building clean, efficient data systems—whether it’s automating KPI reporting for supply chains or designing AI tools for education.  
Currently exploring research in NLP, retrieval-augmented learning, and applied data governance.

**Core Interests:** AI • Machine Learning • NLP • Dashboard Automation • Data Quality & Governance
